AIM:-
    Modify your code to display subjectivity along with the polarity score.

ALGORITHM:-

1. Start the program.

2. Import the required TextBlob library.

3. Display a welcome message to the user.

4. Read a sentence or paragraph as input from the user.

5. Convert the input text into a TextBlob object.

6. Calculate:

    Polarity using analysis.sentiment.polarity

    Subjectivity using analysis.sentiment.subjectivity

7. Determine the sentiment based on polarity:

  If polarity > 0 → Sentiment is Positive

  If polarity < 0 → Sentiment is Negative

  If polarity = 0 → Sentiment is Neutral

8. Display the polarity score, subjectivity score, and sentiment class to the user.

9. Stop the program.


PROCEDURE:-

1. Install the TextBlob library using pip install textblob.

2. Download TextBlob corpora if required using python -m textblob.download_corpora.

3. In a Python IDE (IDLE / VS Code / Jupyter), create a file named sentiment.py.

4. Type the program given below and save the file.

5. Execute the program.

6. Enter any text when prompted.

7. View the polarity, subjectivity, and sentiment results displayed on the screen.



PROGRAM:-

from textblob import TextBlob

print("Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis System")
print("This system evaluates text and displays polarity and subjectivity scores.\n")

user_i = input("Enter the text to analyze: ")

analysis = TextBlob(user_i)
polarity = analysis.sentiment.polarity
subjectivity = analysis.sentiment.subjectivity

if polarity > 0:
    sentiment = "Positive"
elif polarity < 0:
    sentiment = "Negative"
else:
    sentiment = "Neutral"

print("\n----- Sentiment Analysis Result -----")
print(f"Polarity Score     : {polarity}")
print(f"Subjectivity Score : {subjectivity}")
print(f"Overall Sentiment  : {sentiment}")



SAMPLE OUTPUT:-

Enter the text to analyze: I enjoy learning AI. It is fun and exciting.

----- Sentiment Analysis Result -----
Polarity Score     : 0.65
Subjectivity Score : 0.75
Overall Sentiment  : Positive


RESULT:-

The experiment was successfully performed.
The developed Python program analyzed the entered text using the TextBlob library and generated the polarity score, subjectivity score, and the corresponding sentiment classification accurately.


how to run the code :-

python -m venv venv
pip install textblob

python 1.py (or) file name

input:- I enjoy learning AI. It is fun and exciting.
