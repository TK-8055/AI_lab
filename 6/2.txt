AIM:-
  Write a query to find all doctors who treat a given disease from the knowledge base

ALGORITHM:-

1. Import required modules from kanren.

2. Load the existing knowledge base containing relations doctor and treats.

3. Accept a disease name from the user.

4. Create a logic variable to search for matching doctors.

5. Use run() to retrieve all doctors who satisfy the predicate treats(doctor, disease).

6. Display the list of doctors or show a message if none are found.

7. End the program.



PROGRAM:-


import collections
import collections.abc

# Fix for kanren new Python versions
collections.Iterator = collections.abc.Iterator
collections.Hashable = collections.abc.Hashable

from kanren import Relation, facts, run, var

# Knowledge Base
doctor = Relation()
treats = Relation()

facts(doctor,
    ("dr_smith",),
    ("dr_jones",),
    ("dr_lee",),
    ("dr_williams",),
    ("dr_davis",)
)

facts(treats,
    ("dr_smith", "flu"),
    ("dr_smith", "allergy"),
    ("dr_jones", "cold"),
    ("dr_lee", "covid"),
    ("dr_lee", "pneumonia"),
    ("dr_williams", "diabetes"),
    ("dr_davis", "hypertension")
)

# Query to find all doctors treating a given disease
disease = input("Enter a disease: ").strip().lower()
x = var()
result = run(0, x, treats(x, disease))

if result:
    print("\nDoctors who treat", disease, ":")
    for name in result:
        print("-", name.replace("_", " ").title())
else:
    print("\nNo doctor found for this disease.")




SAMPLE OUTPUT:-


Enter a disease: covid

Doctors who treat covid :
- Dr Lee



RESULT:-

The program was successfully executed and returned all doctors who treat
 the given disease from the First-Order Logic (FOL) knowledge base.
