AIM:-

Design a rule-based Expert System for Medical Diagnosis using forward chaining in
Python.




ALGORITHM

1. Start the program.

2. Define a knowledge base containing rules, where each rule links symptoms to a disease.

3. Display instructions and accept symptoms from the user.

4. Convert the user-provided symptoms into a set for easy comparison.

5. For each rule in the knowledge base:

    Check whether the rule’s symptom set is a subset of the user’s symptoms.

    If yes, infer and store the corresponding disease.

6. If one or more rules match, display the inferred diseases.

7. If no rules match, display a message indicating no diagnosis can be made.

8. End the program.




PROGRAM:-


# Rule-Based Expert System for Medical Diagnosis using Forward Chaining

# Knowledge Base (Rules)
rules = [
    {"if": {"fever", "cough", "fatigue"}, "then": "Flu"},
    {"if": {"fever", "cough", "shortness of breath"}, "then": "COVID-19"},
    {"if": {"headache", "nausea", "sensitivity to light"}, "then": "Migraine"},
    {"if": {"sore throat", "runny nose", "sneezing"}, "then": "Common Cold"},
    {"if": {"chest pain", "shortness of breath", "dizziness"}, "then": "Heart Attack"},
]

# Forward Chaining Inference Engine
def diagnose(symptoms):
    matched_diseases = []
    symptoms_set = set(symptoms)

    for rule in rules:
        if rule["if"].issubset(symptoms_set):
            matched_diseases.append(rule["then"])

    return matched_diseases

# User Interface
def main():
    print("=== Forward Chaining Medical Expert System ===")
    print("Enter your symptoms separated by commas (e.g., fever, cough):")

    user_input = input("Symptoms: ").lower()
    symptoms = [s.strip() for s in user_input.split(",")]

    diagnoses = diagnose(symptoms)

    if diagnoses:
        print("\nPossible diagnosis(es):")
        for disease in diagnoses:
            print(f"- {disease}")
    else:
        print("\nNo matching diagnosis found — please consult a doctor.")

# Run Program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()



SAMPLE OUTPUT:-


=== Forward Chaining Medical Expert System ===
Enter your symptoms separated by commas (e.g., fever, cough):
Symptoms: fever, cough, fatigue

Possible diagnosis(es):
- Flu


=== Forward Chaining Medical Expert System ===
Symptoms: chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath

Possible diagnosis(es):
- Heart Attack



RESULT:-


The forward chaining medical expert system was successfully implemented 
and accurately inferred diseases based on user-provided symptoms.
