AIM:-

   Extend the system to display multiple possible diseases when symptoms overlap
with more than one rule.


ALGORITHM:-


1. Start the program.

2. Define a knowledge base using rules where each rule maps a set of symptoms to a disease.

3. Accept symptoms from the user as input.

4. Convert the entered symptoms into a set.

5. For each rule in the knowledge base:

    Check if the rule’s symptom set is a subset of the user’s symptom set.

    If yes, append the corresponding disease to the output list (allowing multiple diseases).

6. If one or more rules match, display all inferred diseases.

7. If no rule matches, display a message advising to consult a doctor.

8. End the program.




PROGRAM:-


# Extended Rule-Based Expert System for Medical Diagnosis using Forward Chaining

# Knowledge Base (Rules)
rules = [
    {"if": {"fever", "cough", "fatigue"}, "then": "Flu"},
    {"if": {"fever", "cough", "shortness of breath"}, "then": "COVID-19"},
    {"if": {"cough", "fatigue", "shortness of breath"}, "then": "Pneumonia"},
    {"if": {"sore throat", "runny nose", "sneezing"}, "then": "Common Cold"},
    {"if": {"headache", "nausea", "sensitivity to light"}, "then": "Migraine"},
    {"if": {"chest pain", "shortness of breath", "dizziness"}, "then": "Heart Attack"},
]

# Forward Chaining Inference Engine
def diagnose(symptoms):
    matched_diseases = []
    symptoms_set = set(symptoms)

    for rule in rules:
        if rule["if"].issubset(symptoms_set):
            matched_diseases.append(rule["then"])
    return matched_diseases

# User Interface
def main():
    print("=== Extended Medical Expert System (Multiple Diagnosis Support) ===")
    print("Enter your symptoms separated by commas (e.g., fever, cough):")

    user_input = input("Symptoms: ").lower()
    symptoms = [s.strip() for s in user_input.split(",")]

    diagnoses = diagnose(symptoms)

    if diagnoses:
        print("\nPossible diagnosis(es):")
        for disease in diagnoses:
            print(f"- {disease}")
    else:
        print("\nNo matching diagnosis found — please consult a doctor.")

# Run Program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()



SAMPLE OUTPUT:-


=== Extended Medical Expert System (Multiple Diagnosis Support) ===
Symptoms: fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue

Possible diagnosis(es):
- Flu
- COVID-19
- Pneumonia



RESULT:-

The expert system was successfully extended to display multiple possible 
diseases when overlapping symptoms match more than one rule.
