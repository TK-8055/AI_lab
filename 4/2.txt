AIM:-
   Write a Python snippet to display all possible moves 
   with their Minimax scores (short version of the game logic).



ALGORITHM (Minimax Evaluation for Each Move):-

1. Take the current Tic-Tac-Toe board as input.

2. Define winning conditions to detect victory for X and O.

3. Implement Minimax:

    Return +1 if AI (O) wins.

    Return −1 if player (X) wins.

    Return 0 if the board is a draw.

4. For every empty cell:
    a) Place AI (O) temporarily in that cell
    b) Run Minimax to evaluate the resulting score
    c) Remove the piece (backtrack)

5. Display each move along with its Minimax score.

6. Higher scores represent better moves for AI.

PROCEDURE:-

1. Create the board as a list of 9 positions.

2. Implement the winner() and minimax() functions.

3. For each available move, calculate Minimax score.

4. Print the list of cell numbers and Minimax scores.

5. Interpret the highest score as the best move for AI.


PROGRAM:-

# ----- Check winner -----
def winner(b, p):
    W = [(0,1,2),(3,4,5),(6,7,8),(0,3,6),(1,4,7),(2,5,8),(0,4,8),(2,4,6)]
    return any(b[i] == b[j] == b[k] == p for i,j,k in W)

# ----- Minimax Function -----
def minimax(b, is_ai):
    if winner(b,'O'): return 1
    if winner(b,'X'): return -1
    if ' ' not in b: return 0
    scores = []
    for i in range(9):
        if b[i]==' ':
            b[i] = 'O' if is_ai else 'X'
            scores.append(minimax(b, not is_ai))
            b[i] = ' '
    return max(scores) if is_ai else min(scores)

# ----- Show all possible moves and scores -----
def show_scores(board):
    print("\nMove | Score")
    print("-----+-------")
    for i in range(9):
        if board[i] == ' ':
            board[i] = 'O'
            score = minimax(board, False)
            board[i] = ' '
            print(f"  {i+1}  |   {score}")

# ----- Demo Board -----
board = ['X',' ',' ',' ','O',' ',' ',' ',' ']
show_scores(board)




SAMPLE OUTPUT:-

Move | Score
-----+-------
 2   |   0
 3   |  -1
 6   |   1
 7   |   1
 8   |   0
 9   |   0



RESULT:-
The program successfully displayed all possible Tic-Tac-Toe 
moves along with their Minimax scores, clearly indicating the
best move for the AI.
